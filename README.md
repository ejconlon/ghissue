# ghissue
Command-line Github issues client. This is super early, and just posting for help from friends.

## Running

stack build
stack exec ghissue-exe show

## Configuring

This is currently done by having a file ".ghissue.config" in the current directory
with one line of the format:
```
oauthstring githuborg repo
```
To get an oauth string, go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and create a new token. Copy the
auth string and save it into that file.

## Usage
